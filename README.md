What is a Binary Tree? It is a hierarchical structure similar to a family tree, where each member (node) can have children (sub-nodes).
Binary Aspect: In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.
Basic Components of a Binary Tree:
Node: Each element in a binary tree is called a node. A node contains some data (value) and pointers/references to its left child and right child nodes (or NULL if no child exists).

Root Node: The topmost node in the tree is called the root node. It's the starting point for traversing the tree.

Child Nodes: Nodes directly connected below another node are its children. Each node can have at most two children, a left child and a right child.

Leaf Nodes: Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes. They are at the ends of branches in the tree.
